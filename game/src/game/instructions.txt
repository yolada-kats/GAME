     The player starting his journey in the map of 
 Greece following a predetermined route from Crete,
    aiming to reach Delphi, depending on the area 
 in which it is located, is facing three types of games:

GAMES:
1)QUESTIONS:In this particular game 4 questions are 
   asked to the player,always based on the destination, 
    at which he has to choose the correct answer (from 
      the 4 available) in order to contribute points 
                            to its overall score.

2)PES-VRES:In this case the user is asked to find 4 
  specific words, each time, related to the city and its 
      history. Depending on how many he finds,
 his corresponding score for each stop is calculated.

3)ANAGRAM:The player, in whichever destination he 
   has to face this game, is asked to place the letters in 
the correct order in order to create the requested word. 
The requested words are 4 and the possibility of wrong
      letter selection is up to 3 times in each of them.

Then, after the player has gone through all the available 
    stops on the Greek map, his total point collection is
                         displayed on the screen.
